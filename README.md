A roadmap for this project:

Part 1: Set-up packages for web scraping.<br/>
Part 2: Find CSS tags to input into Python code.<br/>
Part 3: Write Python code to import packages, prepare variables and define functions.<br/>
Part 4: Finish Python code to trigger functions and save data to CSV file.<br/>
Part 5: Create a word cloud visualization to analyze differences in synopsis keywords between different groups of ratings.<br/>
